  Your are surprised by the sight of a sparkling pool. 
  The pool is located on top of the ship, surrounded by large windows 
  that provide a stunning view of the stars and planets outside. 
  The water is crystal clear and inviting, and the pool is filled 
  with a special type of chlorine that is safe for use in outer space.
