  You emerging from the dense jungle and couldn't believe
  your eyes when seeing the ancient, lost village in front of you.
  The stone buildings are weathered and worn, but the intricate carvings
  and symbols etched into the walls spoke to the incredible sophistication
  and advanced technology of the civilization that had once inhabited this place.
