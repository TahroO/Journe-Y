  As you enter a cabin of the spaceship, you are immediately struck
  by its sleek and futuristic design. The walls are made of a shimmering metallic material
  that seems to shift and change color as you move around the room.
  The lighting is soft and subtle, casting a warm glow throughout the space.
  The bed is covered with soft, silky blankets and pillows that seem to adjust to a body,
  providing the perfect level of support and comfort.
  As you explore the cabin further, you notice a number of strange
  and fascinating devices and gadgets.
