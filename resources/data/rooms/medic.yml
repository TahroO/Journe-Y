  As you enter a medic station you approach one of the tables 
  and see a number of strange, glowing crystals on display. 
  As you pick one up, you feel a tingling sensation in your hand, 
  as if the crystal is alive and pulsing with energy. 
  You place the crystal back down and move on to the next table, 
  where you see a series of beakers and flasks containing a variety of colorful liquids. 
  There are computers and monitors everywhere.
