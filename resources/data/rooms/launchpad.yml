  You reach a launch pad, a vast, cavernous room filled with 
  strange and exotic spacecraft of all shapes and sizes. 
  Some of the ships are sleek and streamlined, designed for high-speed travel 
  through the cosmos, while others are rugged and utilitarian, 
  built for endurance and durability.
