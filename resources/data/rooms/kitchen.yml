  As you enter the kitchen, you are immediately struck by the unfamiliar smells 
  that fill the room. The kitchen is a large, open space filled with a variety 
  of strange and exotic cooking equipment and ingredients.
  You approach one of the counters and see a number of strange looking fruits and vegetables
  laid out in a neat row. You pick up one of the fruits and examine it closely, 
  noting its spiky exterior and the pungent aroma that wafts from it. 
  You place the fruit back down and move on to the next counter, where you see a variety of
  cooking pots and pans bubbling with a variety of exotic-looking dishes.
