  You stand in front of a teleporter which is a marvel of technology,
  capable of transporting beings instantaneously to yet unknown locations.
  For sure this was a popular mode of transportation for the native alien species.
  However, the teleporter seems to have some limitations, 
  as it could only transport organic material
  within the planet's atmosphere and is not able to reach other planets or galaxies."
