  The familiar AI Voice speaks again:
  
  
  “The bio reactor is a complex system that is responsible 
  for generating and sustaining the life support systems on the ship. 
  It uses a combination of advanced biotechnology and artificial intelligence 
  to convert organic matter into energy, oxygen, and other essential resources.”
  
  
  You notice a series of monitors and screens that display a constant stream of data 
  and information about the reactor's performance and status.
