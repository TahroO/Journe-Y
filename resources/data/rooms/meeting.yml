  You run into some kind of meeting room, a spacious, open area 
  with a high ceiling and large windows that provide stunning views of the outside. 
  The room is filled with a variety of comfortable chairs, each one designed 
  to accommodate the zero gravity during long space rides.
  
  
  You take a seat in one of the chairs and sink into the soft cushions, 
  feeling a sense of weightlessness and freedom.
