  You find yourself inside the main processor server room of the spaceship.
  The hum of complex machinery fills the air.
  Rows of sleek, metallic servers line the walls, their glowing screens flickering
  with data and code. The room is dimly lit, with only a few strategically
  placed spotlights illuminating the rows of servers.
  
  This is the heart of the ship's computing system, responsible for managing all
  of the ship's functions and systems. It is constantly processing and analyzing data,
  making calculations and decisions at lightning fast speeds.
